## Contributing to GoGit

Hi! At first I should appreciate you for taking time to contribute. 
The following items are the rules we should consider  contributing the repo.


## Where should I start?
- There may be some issues on the repo that you can pick one, leave a comment and start working on it.
- You can also open an issue for the repo and then leave a comment for me to let me know you want to work on it.


## What's the rules?
-  **Add tests!**  - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
-  **Document any change in behaviour**  - Make sure the  `README.md`  and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
-  **Create feature branches**  - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
-  **One pull request per feature**  - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
